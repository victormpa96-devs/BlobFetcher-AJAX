Project to test the use of Blob that allows to fetch an image from an external URL, make use of Blob in the response and then retrieve a temporary URL with createObjectURL to display them on screen. 

In addition, you can send data in JSON format to a server that receives a processed response and displays it on screen.

In essence, this project combines AJAX, DOM manipulation, and technologies such as Blob and Fetch API to test how these methodologies work.
